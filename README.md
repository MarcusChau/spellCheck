# Spell Checker #

This is a python application which allows the user to input text, paragraphs, etc. and have this program autocorrect and underrline the spelling errors.

## How it works ##

Program prompts the user to input text(paragraph, sentence, etc.) --> The program will run and compare the words within the imported American dictionary and autocorrect accordingly --> Example of a correction would be changing a letter in the word to see if it matches a word in the dictionary --> After correction, program will then return the corrected text and have the changed words underlined. 

## Prerequisites ##

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3 is installed
- American dictionary (Can be found in my repo or online) imported and saved in the directory of the program 
- Keyboard letters file (Can be found in my repo or online or manually typed) imported and saved in the directory of the program

## Development Expansion ##

This application can be expanded to be even more accurate, check grammatical errors, and or even be applied to different languages. It can also incorperate machine learning in order to more efficently check. My approach of this would be to seperate the this into multiple py files and have each one check for a specific error and then also have a main to be able to control all of them locally. This can use machine learning by using PyTorch or Scikit-learn.
